# Off-Window Side Panel

You know that thing where where you click a menu button, and everything slides over?

Here's a simple method to build one of those.

Patterned after the [tutorial](http://scotch.io/tutorials/off-canvas-menus-with-css3-transitions-and-transforms) by Nicholas Cerminara.

This uses Bootstrap and jQuery, but it could easily be cut free of those.
